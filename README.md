wAveC - View AC Current and Voltage Waveforms
=============================================

Often it is useful to simultaneously view the current and voltage waveforms
for a load. Breaking out the high-voltage phase line for attaching an
oscilloscope can be precarious. This device is a simple way to plug in
a load and run BNC cables to a scope to see a real-time view of the
waveforms.
